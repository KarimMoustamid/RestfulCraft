# ASP.NET Core API Development Path

This repository is a comprehensive guide for learning how to build secure, robust, and high-performing APIs using the ASP.NET Core framework. APIs are essential for data exchange between mobile apps, desktop applications, and modern web frameworks like Angular, React, and Blazor. This path walks through the entire process of API development, from understanding the fundamentals to mastering advanced topics.

## Key Topics Covered:
- **REST Concepts & Fundamentals**: Learn the principles behind RESTful services and how they form the backbone of modern API development.
- **ASP.NET Core API Fundamentals**: Build your first APIs using the ASP.NET Core framework.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization techniques to secure your APIs.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Add logging capabilities and learn how to monitor the performance and usage of your APIs.
- **API Documentation**: Make your API developer-friendly by integrating Swagger and generating comprehensive documentation.
- **React + API Integration**: Gain practical knowledge on how to create a React application that consumes data from an ASP.NET Core API.
- **Asynchronous APIs**: Learn how to handle high-throughput scenarios by making APIs asynchronous.
- **Advanced Topics**: Dive into OpenID Connect, deploying APIs with Azure API Management, and using Minimal APIs to streamline development.

By the end of this path, you'll be equipped to build APIs that power modern applications and integrate with a variety of front-end technologies. You'll also be ready to explore other ASP.NET Core technologies like Razor Pages and server-side web applications.
